                Plagiarism is the unethical act of copying someone else's prior ideas, processes,
                results or words without explicit acknowledgement of the original author and source.
                Self-plagiarism occurs when an author utilizes large part of his/her own previously
                published work without using appropriate references. This can range from getting
                the same manuscript published in multiple journals to modifying a previously
                published manuscript with some new data.

                <b>International Journal of Computer Sciences and Engineering,</b> is a peer
                reviewed indexed monthly online journal having ISSN 2347-2693, being published since
                2013. The journal is strictly against any unethical act of copying or plagiarism in
                any form. Plagiarism is said to have occurred when large portions of a manuscript
                have been copied from existing previously published resources.{" "}
                <span style={{ color: "#FF0000" }}>
                  All manuscripts submitted for publication to IJCSE are cross-checked for
                  Plagiarism / Similarity Index using Turnitin / Plagiarism CheckerX software
                </span>
                . Manuscripts found to be plagiarized during initial stages of review are
                out-rightly rejected and not considered for publication in the journal.
              </p>

              <p>
                In case a manuscript is found to be plagiarized after publication, the
                Editor-in-Chief will conduct preliminary investigation, may be with the help of a
                suitable committee constituted for the purpose. If the manuscript is found to be
                plagiarized beyond the acceptable limits, the journal will contact the author's
                Institute / College / University and Funding Agency, if any. A determination of
                misconduct will lead IJCSE to run a statement bi-directionally linked online to and
                from the original paper, to note the plagiarism and provide a reference to the
                plagiarized material. The paper containing the plagiarism will also be marked on
                each page of the PDF. Upon determination of the extent of plagiarism, the paper may
                also be formally retracted.

                <b>Types of Plagiarism </b>
                <br />
                The following types of plagiarism are considered by IJCSE:-
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Full Plagiarism:</strong> Previously published content without any changes
                  to the text, idea and grammar is considered as full plagiarism. It involves
                  presenting exact text from a source as oneâ€™s own.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Partial Plagiarism:</strong> If content is a mixture from multiple
                  different sources, where the author has extensively rephrased text, then it is
                  known as partial plagiarism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Self-Plagiarism:</strong> When an author reuses complete or portions of
                  their pre-published research, then it is known as self-plagiarism. Complete
                  self-plagiarism is a case when an author republishes their own previously
                  published work in a new journal.
                </li>
              </ol>
